This article discusses the potential benefits of a "longevity diet" which could potentially add an extra decade to a person's life. The diet consists of mostly beans and vegetables, with no meat or alcohol, and is based on more than a human lifespan of scientific research. The article explains that while it is well known that diets can affect lifespans, this diet is designed to slow down the ageing process.

The Western diet, which is high in sugars, refined starches, and saturated fats and low in wholefoods, has been linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. A recent study from the University of Bergen in Norway revealed that this obesogenic, disease-promoting, and pro-ageing diet is shortening our lives. The study found that between 1970 and 2009, average daily calorie intake in the US rose by 20%, and other Western countries have followed this trend. The researchers modelled what would happen if people reduced their calorie intake to the recommended level, and found that it could lead to a longer life expectancy.

Switching to an optimal diet that includes more wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes and fish and less meat, dairy, refined grains and sugary drinks can significantly extend life expectancy. According to the Global Burden of Disease study, people who switch to this diet at age 20 can expect to gain an extra 10 years of life expectancy for women and 13 years for men. Even those who switch later in life can still benefit, with 60-year-olds gaining an extra 8 years and 80-year-olds gaining an extra 3.4 years.

Researchers have long believed that a healthy diet can help to prevent diseases linked to a bad diet, and that it may even be possible to slow the ageing process. In 1917, experiments at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven showed that female rats that had been starved as pups lived longer than average. This "caloric restriction without malnutrition" was achieved by cutting calories by up to 60% while supplementing the diet with vitamins and minerals. Recent studies have suggested that a similar diet could extend the lifespan of humans by up to seven years if adopted at age 20. The longevity expectations are thought to be linked to a reduction in cardiovascular disease and cancer risk.
Caloric restriction has been shown to extend healthspan and lifespan in a variety of organisms, including mice, which can live up to 50% longer than average. However, it is difficult to replicate this in humans due to the difficulty of halving energy intake for a long period of time. There is also no evidence yet that caloric restriction has long-term health benefits in humans.
Caloric restriction has been shown to extend the lifespan of many species, and there is evidence to suggest that it could have the same effect on humans. This is due to a network of metabolic pathways that respond to the availability of nutrients by toggling cells between two states: feast and famine. When nutrients are scarce, cells are told to hunker down and await better days, resulting in a maintenance mode and reduced ageing. However, it is important to note that no one should restrict their diet to the extent that it damages their health.
The process of autophagy is important for preventing cellular damage that leads to ageing. It involves sweeping up intracellular debris and burning it as fuel. Starvation also boosts repair processes which can reverse damage that has already been done. The insulin receptor and mTOR are key players in the nutrient-sensing system, with mTOR being the linchpin of the feast-famine system. When mTOR is on, autophagy and repair switch off.
Caloric restriction has been shown to have positive effects on insulin sensitivity, liver function, and weight loss in both animals and humans. However, it is difficult to stick to such a strict diet. There is evidence that less-onerous diets, such as periodic fasting or time-restricted eating, can have similar effects. These diets involve restricting calories some of the time, such as for two days each week or for up to four consecutive days a month. Intermittent fasting and fasting-mimicking diets are two approaches to dieting that have been linked to increased longevity. Protein restriction is another diet that has been shown to promote longevity in rodents, but is more complicated to follow. All of these diets are designed to tap into the body's anti-ageing pathways, with the goal of increasing healthspan as well as lifespan.
Amino-acid restriction is a dietary intervention that limits the consumption of some of the building blocks of proteins, such as methionine and tryptophan. This is done to reduce the activity of mTOR, though the exact mechanism is not yet understood. While this type of restriction is less effective than full-on caloric restriction, it is easier to implement and has led to the emergence of anti-ageing diets.

A new review paper published in the journal Cell suggests a "longevity diet" that could potentially add years to a person's life. The diet is based on decades of research on the biology of aging, the effects of caloric restriction, and the health benefits of various food groups. It also takes into account the dietary habits of people living in longevity hotspots such as Okinawa in Japan and Sardinia in Italy.

Valter Longo, a professor of gerontology and biological sciences, has developed a diet that he believes can extend a person's life expectancy by up to 20 years. The diet consists of caloric restriction, time-restricted feeding, periodic fasting-mimicking cycles, and a largely plant-based diet. While the diet has yet to be tested in trials, Longo believes it is based on evidence from epidemiology, clinical trials, basic research, and centenarian studies. However, some experts are skeptical of the benefits of time-restricted feeding, as the evidence for it is still limited. Despite the widespread belief that caloric restriction can lead to longer life, research has shown that it only works in about half of the cases, and in some cases it can even lead to shorter life. Additionally, people who attempt caloric restriction often experience unpleasant side effects, such as disturbed thermoregulation, loss of libido, and increased susceptibility to infection. Despite these warnings, Valter Longo is confident that the fasting-mimicking diet can be kept safe.

Dr. Valter Longo has developed a longevity diet that he believes will improve health and extend life. He has secured funding for an 18-month clinical trial in Italy to test the diet on 500 people. The diet includes a combination of caloric restriction, 16 hours of daily fasting, and a monthly bout of the fasting-mimicking diet. Longo follows the diet himself and has done so for 30 years, and believes it is safe and effective.
