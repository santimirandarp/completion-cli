Abstract: - Lanolin also called wool wax or wool grease is a yellow waxy substance secreted by the sebaceous
glands of wool-bearing animals. Most lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised
specifically for their wool. Crude lanolin constitutes about 5–25% of the weight of freshly shorn wool. The wool
from one Merino sheep will produce about 250–300 ml of recoverable wool grease. Lanolin is extracted by
scouring the wool in hot water with a detergent to remove dirt, wool grease (crude lanolin), suint (sweat salts),
and anything else stuck to the wool. The wool grease is continuously removed during this washing process
by centrifugal separators, which concentrate it into a wax-like substance melting at approximately 38°C. Lanolin
and its many derivatives are extracted from wool scouring liquor and converted to a value added products that
are generally used extensively in both the personal care (e.g. in high value cosmetics, facial cosmetics, lip
products, etc.) and health care sectors. It is frequently used in protective baby skin treatment and as a treatment
for sore nipples in breastfeeding mothers. Lanolin is used commercially in many industrial products ranging
from rust-proof coatings to lubricants.

INTRODUCTION

Wool is a natural, protein, multi-cellular, staple fibre from the fleece of domesticated sheep. Wool fibre
contains different contaminants such as Natural, acquired and applied. Natural impurities in the fleece consist
primarily of wool grease and suint that are produced by the sheep. Wool grease is secreted from the sheep‟s skin
and accumulates in the wool fibre as it grows. Wool grease is a mixture of fats and oils with a combined melting
point of approximately 40°C. After separation during scouring, wool wax is contaminated with detergent and
suint and is, therefore called wool grease, as distinct from wool wax [1]. Wool grease can be emulsified in water
by the addition of a detergent. Suint is made up from a mixture of primarily potassium-based salts of fatty acids,
such as oleic and stearic acids. It is excreted from the sweat glands of the sheep and dries onto the skin and wool
fibres. Suint is highly soluble in water and can be isolated from the raw wool by aqueous extraction. Acquired
impurities are picked up from the animal‟s natural environment and can be categorized as mineral or vegetable
contaminants. Mineral contaminants include dirt, dust, sand and stones. These are usually quite straightforward
to remove by washing. Vegetable matter (VM) caught in the animal‟s fleece commonly includes straw, grass,
seedpods, pieces of plant tissue and twigs. Parasites such as ticks and blowfly maggots as well as faeces
attached to the wool are generally defined as VM along with the true vegetable contaminants. Applied
impurities cover the range of farm chemicals such as sheep dip and fertilizers applied directly to the sheep or to
the pasture upon which they are grazing. These generally only occur in trace quantities and can be very difficult
to separate from the other contaminants.
The use of crude wool grease washed from the fleece of sheep has been known for centuries. The
ancient Greeks (about 700 B.C.) are known to have extracted it by boiling wool and skimming “fat” from the
surface. Liebrich and Braun of Germany are credited with developing the first refined neutral wool grease and
coining the name “lanolin” in 1882.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF WOOL GREASE

Wool Grease is a natural substance excreted from the sebaceous gland attached to the root of each wool fibre in
the basal layer of the sheep‟s skin [2].

The wax excretion forms a hydrophobic coating on the fibre, protecting it from the elements. By chemical
definition, the absence of glycerol in this oily excretion makes it a wax. Wool wax itself is a complex mixture of
naturally occurring esters of water, insoluble alcohols and higher fatty acids.

Isolation of specific esters is extremely difficult and seldom attempted [3-10] but detailed analysis has
been carried out on the free acids and alcohols from which the esters are formed. In 1954 a large range of wool
wax acids were identified and found to fall into 4 distinct series: normal (Fig a), iso- (Fig b) anteiso- (Fig c), and
hydroxy-acids (Fig d). Examples of each series are given below:

Alcoholic Fraction

From a practical perspective, the wool grease dispersed in scour effluent consists of two main fractions,
typically referred to as „oxidised‟ and „unoxidised‟ wool grease. The oxidised wool grease has been shown to be
associated with the tip of the wool staple where the grease is exposed to the air and the external environment
while the unoxidised fraction has been shown to be more predominant at the base and centre of the wool staple
[3-10]. It is generally agreed that the oxidised fraction has a higher density than the unoxidised, but the actual
values reported in various works vary widely.

III.

WOOL GREASE RECOVERY

Due to its low specific gravity, unoxidised wool wax is most commonly recovered by passing the scour
effluent through a centrifuge. At present, stacked disc centrifuges similar to those employed in the dairy industry
are used in either a 2 or 3 stage separation and purification process. The main processes used throughout the
world for wool grease recovery involve some combination of thermal cracking and centrifuging. Solvent
extraction methods have been extensively developed and typically give a very high quality product [3-10], but
these technologies have never gained widespread use.

Fig 3 Primary centrifuge
3.1 SINGLE-STAGE WOOL GREASE RECOVERY
Scour effluent heated to at least 64°C is fed from above into the centre section of the primary centrifuge as
shown in Figure 3. Inside the centrifuge the effluent flows into the stack of cone shaped discs, which rotate at
approximately 6000rpm [1-10]. In the disc stack the lighter wool grease flows upwards between the discs
towards the centre of the bowl where it is discharged as primary cream. A second emulsion phase flows
downwards between the discs due to its higher density, from where it flows up the walls of the outer bowl and is
also discharged at the top of the centrifuge. Any dirt and heavy solids in the feed are also carried downwards
between the discs but, due to having higher density than the aqueous emulsion phase, do not flow up the walls
with the emulsion phase and are continuously discharged through jets in the bottom of the bowl wall. The
primary cream is then fed into a thermal-cracking tank where it is held for in excess of five hours at
approximately 90°C. Over this period the cream splits into three distinct phases.

Fig 4 Single-stage wool wax recovery
After the solution has been given time to separate, the heavy aqueous phase is drawn off the bottom of the tank
to drain, the emulsion phase is recycled to the centrifuge and then the wool grease floating in the top of the tank
is drawn off into drums. Due to the rising value of recovered wool grease and mounting restrictions on effluent
discharges, single stage wool grease recovery is no longer used in the main stream scouring industry.

3.2 TWO-STAGE WOOL GREASE RECOVERY
In a two-stage system, primary centrifuges and thermal cracking tanks are again used, but this time the cream
and emulsion from the cracking tank is fed to a bank of secondary centrifuges for further purification. In a twostage system the cream from the primary centrifuges is around 60 – 80% wool wax. The product from the
secondary centrifuges is typically in excess of 99% pure. [10]

Fig 5 Two-Stage Wool Grease Recovery

3.3 THREE-STAGE WOOL GREASE RECOVERY
In a three-stage system a greater overall proportion of the wool grease is recovered from the effluent by
the primary centrifuges. The resultant primary cream however is typically only 10 – 20% grease. This high
volume low strength primary cream is then thermally cracked and passed through the secondary centrifuge at
approximately 90°C resulting in a secondary cream containing 70– 80% wool grease. The cream from the
secondary centrifuge, still at 90°C, is then passed to a purifying centrifuge where it is mixed with clean hot
water (which aids in washing impurities from the grease) and is then separated to produce wool grease with
purity in excess of 99%.

LANOLIN REFINEMENT

The harvested wool wax is a dark, highly viscous and greasy paste. In this crude form, it can be used in
several technical applications. However, due to the colour, peculiar odour and sizeable amount of impurities it
retains at this stage, the wool wax must be refined further before it can be used in cosmetic products and by the
pharmaceutical industry [11, 12].

4.1 FIRST STAGES OF REFINEMENT
The techniques and materials used for refining lanolin vary from processor to processor. Generally, the
first step involves the break-up of soaps and removal of acid-soluble impurities by refluxing the crude wool wax
in an aqueous acid solution. After separation and disposal of the aqueous phase, the free fatty acids in the wax
are neutralized via an alkaline treatment, preferably using a sodium hydroxide or carbonate solution. The
resulting soaps, which are formed by the reaction of fatty acids with alkali metal ions such as sodium, can be
extracted using mixtures of ethanol or isopropanol with water. The alcohols function both as a co-solvent and an
agent to reduce the emulsifying properties of surfactant molecules. This makes sure that undesired materials are
washed out of the wax mixture effectively.
4.2 IMPROVING THE PURITY
Depending on the desired purity grade, this extraction procedure can be repeated with more highly
concentrated alcohol mixtures. A further reduction of contaminants can be achieved through treatment with
adsorbents, such as activated carbon, followed by filtration. Residual pesticides and odours can be removed by
exposure to high vacuum and simultaneous heating of the wool wax. This processing step also reduces the
amount of free lanolin alcohols. By slightly varying vacuum and temperature conditions, their content can be
reduced to less than 3% by weight, which is crucial if the desired result is product hypoallergenicity.
4.3 COLOUR CHANGE
At this stage in the refinement process, most of the impurities - free fatty acids, detergents and
pesticides will be sufficiently reduced and the product will be pleasantly deodorised. The dark colour will have
faded into a pale yellow tone. While the colour of the refined lanolin has nothing to do with its quality, some
cosmetic applications require bright lanolin. This can be achieved by bleaching the wax with common oxidative
reagent such as: hydrogen peroxide. If the lanolin is not bleached, then small concentrations of another approved
antioxidant, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), are usually added at the end of the refinement process.
This stops the air getting to the lanolin, preventing superficial degradation by autoxidation.
4.4 FINAL STEPS
Finally, residual water is removed through a vacuum-drying process to give refined lanolin anhydrous, a pale,
ointment-like substance with a scarcely recognisable odour.

APPLICATION OF LANOLIN AND ITS DERIVATIVES

Uses of Lanolin and its derivatives are as follows [14-25]:
5.1 LANOLIN AS A PERSONAL CARE
Wool wax is a natural substance, designed by nature to soften both skin and wool fibres, and to protect
them against adverse weather conditions. The best known uses of refined wool wax products (lanolin and
lanolin derivatives) are in medicine, cosmetics and toiletries, which take advantage of these natural protective
qualities. Lanolin is a key ingredient in some of the world‟s most popular cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
Without it, they would not have the emollient qualities that protect and care for our skin and hair. The
composition of lanolin resembles the intercellular lipids of the stratum corneum. This is the outermost layer of
the skin, which consists of cholesterol, cholesterol derivatives and free fatty acids. These lipids play a crucial
role in the skin‟s moisture control. Under normal conditions, water continuously evaporates from the skin's
surface. Insufficient rehydration from lower epidermal layers leads to a dry, inflexible and brittle stratum
corneum. Anhydrous lanolin can absorb more than 200% of its weight in water (WW) to form stable water-inoil (w/o) emulsions. It's also capable of redistributing this moisture to environments of low relative humidity
[11].

Fig 7 Lanolin is also used in lipsticks and eye make-up
Lanolin is also widely used in:
 foundation creams and other skin-cream products as an emulsifier, stabiliser, emollient and skin
moisturiser;
 oil-based skin lotions and cleansing oils as a skin moisturiser and to control viscosity;
 toilet soaps as a superfatting agent, minimising the dehydrating effect of detergents, and to retain perfume;
 aftershaves as a skin moisturiser and to control viscosity;
 nail polish removers to prevent the defatting of the surrounding skin;
 lipsticks and eye make-up as a film modifier and crystal inhibitor, for more uniformly dispersed pigment;
 hair dressings and shampoos, as a conditioner against drying, scaling and brittleness of the hair shaft;
 hair sprays, as a plasticiser;
 hair bleaching agents, as a pH-stable emulsifier.
5.2 MEDICAL APPLICATIONS: Lanolin is widely used in:
 ointment bases, burns dressings and wound sprays
o as an emulsifier, stabiliser and emollient
o to support the wound healing process
o to deliver active ingredients through the skin (trans-dermal);
 pigmented medications (e.g. zinc oxide), as a dispersing agent;
 topical products for cutaneous infections (e.g. acne) and in deodorising toiletries, as an anti-microbial and
disinfectant.
 ophthalmic ointments, as an emollient with high physiological compatibility and low irritation potential;
 suppositories substantial base, as a carrier for active ingredients;
 surgical adhesive tapes, as an impregnating agent, plasticiser and skin-suited stack enhancer;
 chewing gum bases as a food additive (physiologically compatible emollient);
 pre-blended combinations for specific purposes, such as absorption bases.

5.3 INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION
Lanolin is also used in various industrial applications such as:
 Anti-corrosive effect on ferrous metals
It is biodegradable and non-toxic, making it an ecologically friendly substance. Lanolin is also compatible with
numerous additives that modify the consistency and characteristics of the resulting protective films (e.g. hard,
soft, water soluble or insoluble). Strongly corroded seawater tanks and ships can be rust-protected with low
viscous lanolin products. In the floor method, the liquids are dispersed on the weathered underground. The oil
then creeps into the cavities of the rust structure, where it displaces the water by attaching to the metallic
surface, forming a thick and durable anti-corrosive layer. The high penetration potential of lanolin-based anticorrosive preparations makes them attractive for rust treatment and prevention on automobile parts, especially
on old-timers. Some Special anti-corrosive applications and functions
 As a dewatering rust preventative for saltwater-resistant protection of ships and seawater tanks.
 For protection and conservation of ferrous vehicle and vintage car parts such as:
o crevices of front and car boot lid, wheel house, mudguard, underbody parts and so on;
o engineering parts like cylinder pistons during storage;
o chromed parts for better resistance against road salt, seawater and acid rain;
o for regeneration of bitumen underbody protection.
 For conserving items such as military hardware, conduits, pipelines, machinery, roofing tiles, sheets, plates,
tools, steel wire ropes, surfaces of wood and fabric, and so on.
 Lubricant applications
Combined with its anti-corrosive potential, lanolin is also a valuable lubricating and conserving material for all
types of engineering parts. Other special applications are
 Lubrication grease for engineering parts.
 Metal cutting oil.
 Lubricant for metal processing, e.g. rolling, grinding, pressing and so on.
 Leather and textiles
To protect leather from natural degradation processes, it must be treated by chemical tanning agents to create a
durable product from an organic source. Lanolin is a widely used ingredient for fat liquors, that are applied after
tanning to soften leathers.
Lanolin is used in products for:
 treating and processing tanned leather
 weathered leather, as a nourishing oil and emollient
 shoe polishes, as an emulsifier and gloss enhancer
 Textiles, as an emollient that gives a soft finish.
 Other Industrial uses:
 In paints, spraying varnishes and inks:
o as a dispersing agent for homogeneous covering properties
o preventing aggregation and precipitation of pigments to improve handling of paints
o as an agent to decrease the drying time
o as a penetration inhibitor for inks
o to give and control fluidity.
 In polishing waxes and abrasives.
 As a paper conditioner:
o enhancing paper softness
o imparting steam resistance for wrappings of surgical instruments that have to be sterilized.
 In industrial hand-cleaner creams and lotions as a superfatting agent to minimise the dehydrating effect of
detergents.
 In oil-binding agents, due to the high oil-binding capacity of lanolic acid metal soaps.
 In concrete waterproofing products.
 In numerous other applications, such as aircraft glues, conveyor belt wax, special greases, jointing pastes,
vulcanising pastes and so on.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Detergent oriented wool scouring before dyeing is one of the pollution causing process in the mills
contributing to the maximum of the total BOD, COD and TDS load in effluent. Lanolin is extracted by scouring
the wool fibre in hot water with detergent and other auxiliary chemicals to remove dirt, wool grease (crude

lanolin), suint (sweat salts), and anything else stuck to the wool. The wool grease is continuously removed
during this washing process by centrifugal separators, which concentrate it into a wax-like substance melting at
approximately 38°C. Separation of wool grease from scouring liquor causes reduction in effluent load
contributing less problem areas for waste-water treatment and discharging of wastewater into surface water and
also useful to produce value added products (Ex: Lanolin) that are used as a Personal Care like- cosmetics and
toiletries, medical application like- ointment bases, burns dressings and wound sprays and in different industrial
applications like- Anti-corrosive effect on ferrous metals, Lubrication, Leather and textile industry, Paint and
spray vanishes. Lanolin is not a significant allergen. As the incidence of allergies is less than approximately 6
per million then lanolin is less of an allergen than fish, eggs, strawberries, etc. Super-refined lanolin is available
recording even lower incidence of allergies which is ideal for the use in hypoallergenic cosmetics such as
Lanocreme [13]. Apart from the above mentioned applications, there is lot of scope to produce different value
added products by using various derivatives of wool grease. So, future research should be focus on the technical
textile application and hygienic and hypoallergenic applications in medical textiles and other industrial
applications.
