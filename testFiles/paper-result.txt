This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the chemistry, manufacturing, and applications of lanolin extracted from wool pretreatment. It discusses the composition of wool grease, its extraction process, and its various uses in the personal care and health care sectors. It also provides information on the effluent characteristics of wool grease recovery and the physical and chemical properties of wool wax. Finally, it outlines the various derivatives of lanolin and their applications.
This paper has discussed the process of wool grease recovery and lanolin refinement. Wool grease is recovered from scour effluent by passing it through a centrifuge and then thermally cracking it. This process can be done in a single-stage, two-stage, or three-stage system. Lanolin refinement involves breaking up soaps and removing acid-soluble impurities by refluxing the crude wool wax in an aqueous acid solution, neutralizing the free fatty acids in the wax with an alkaline treatment, extracting the soaps with mixtures of ethanol or isopropanol with water, treating the wax with adsorbents, and exposing it to high vacuum and simultaneous heating. This process results in a product with a pale yellow tone and reduced levels of impurities.
Lanolin is a natural substance derived from sheep's wool, designed by nature to soften both skin and wool fibres, and to protect them against adverse weather conditions. It is widely used in cosmetics and toiletries, medicine, and industrial applications. In cosmetics and toiletries, it is used as an emulsifier, stabiliser, emollient, and skin moisturiser. In medicine, it is used in ointment bases, burns dressings, wound sprays, topical products, and ophthalmic ointments. In industrial applications, it is used as an anti-corrosive, lubricant, and in leather and textile processing.
Lanolin is a wax-like substance extracted from wool during the scouring process. It is used in a variety of applications, such as cosmetics and toiletries, medical applications, industrial applications, and more. It is also used as an agent to decrease drying time, a penetration inhibitor for inks, and to give and control fluidity. It is also used in polishing waxes and abrasives, as a paper conditioner, in industrial hand-cleaner creams and lotions, in oil-binding agents, in concrete waterproofing products, and in numerous other applications.
